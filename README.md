# RamAndCPU

Work in progress

## Source

I just put it all in the top level folder for now:

 **RAMCPUUseage.cpp**
 The file with main
 
 **GetRam1500**
 Class to get ram stats for the current system.  Windows code is largely complete, and I've done almost nothing with Mac.
 
 **GetCPU** 
 Windows part of this is a work in progress with bugs.  Again, I've done almost nothing with the code for Mac OS
